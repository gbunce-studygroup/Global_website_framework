# Mobile Instant Pages Framework

## Front-end framework based on the university website framework for creating branded themes for Mobile Instant Pages (MIP) landing pages.

This brand version and is used to compile themes by editing the variables in `_mip_variables.scss`.

The task for compiling the brand css is `grunt mipbrand`. 

After compiling, copy and paste the contents of `html > css > mip_brand_style.min.css` to the CSS field located in Sitecore at (brand) shared items `shared items > MIP Styles > Site Styles`. Then save & publish.

The global version of this framework is located at [github.com/gbunce-studygroup/MIP_global](https://github.com/gbunce-studygroup/MIP_global). Contact [Gregg](mailto:gbunce@studygroup.com) if you require any amends to the global styles or additional components.
